# InteractiveMachineLearning

Three small applications showing KNN, KMeans and NaiveBayes Classifier

This Script can be started having pygame.

When the tool is started the following keys can be used:

= KNN =

Numbers 1-4: Place a labeled point on the current mouse position

Key a - Area Draw - Display a Grid with coloured points regarding their assigned label
Key l - DrawLines - Display the Label Assignment for the Current Mouse Position as well as the lines to the k-Neigbours

Key +/- Increase/Decrease k

= KMeans =

Numbers 1: Place a data point on the current mouse position
Numbers 2: Place a cluster startpoint point on the current mouse position
Key s: Run the Algorithm
Key c: Clear


= Naive Bayes =

AS KNN

Additionally use the Key p to flicker the borders based on a random number generated absed on the class probabilities
